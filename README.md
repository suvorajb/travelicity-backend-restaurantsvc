This is a nodejs microservice which uses Fetch Promises to invoke Restaurant list REST API and then loop through and invoke photo REST 
Api to get the photo of each restaurant. It uses Google Places API to retrieve the places list. This is a wonderful example of making 
async call after a async call has been finished.
